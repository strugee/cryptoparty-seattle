        <h3 class="bullet">Basically, a threat model is what <em>your</em> adversary looks like</h3>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">What is Tor?</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">You know in those old movies where some kid is breaking into a computer and it shows the map, with the connection bouncing all around the world?</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">That's basically what Tor is.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Tor anonymizes you by making it seem like your requests for web pages are coming from a random location in the world</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Tor can also help you circumvent censorship</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">Using Tor</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">Tor isn't useful on its own</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Instead, you use your normal applications - like email, chat and your web browser - and tell them to send all their data through the Tor network instead of the regular Internet.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">For your web browser, you use the Tor Browser Bundle</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">For other applications, you use their proxy settings</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">For BitTorrent, you do nothing. Don't use BitTorrent with Tor.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">For the truly paranoid, you use Tails</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">The Tor Browser Bundle</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">TBB is a browser, based on Firefox, that is preconfigured to use Tor properly</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">It will help you connect to the Tor network and remain anonymous online</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">However, TBB cannot do everything. You may need to change some of your browsing habits.</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">What you need to do</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">Don't use browser plugins</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Don't open downloaded documents while online</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Be aware of logging in to websites (there's no point being anonymous if you tell them who you are)</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">Tails, The Amnesiac Incognito Live System</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">Tails is like the TBB, but it works for the entire operating system.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Instead of starting Tails from your hard drive, you put Tails on a CD and start the computer from the CD.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">When you shut down Tails, it forgets about everything you did.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Start fresh when moving on to the next task by restarting Tails.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">The warning about signing into things still applies, but otherwise, Tails is pretty hassle-free. <em>Everything</em> goes through Tor.</h3>

        <h3 class="bullet"><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en">Download</a> the Tor Browser Bundle and unpack to your desktop. It is self-contained, no need to install</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">If you are paranoid you may wish to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en">verify its signature</a> to ensure it hasn't been tampered with</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Download Tails from <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">here</a> and <a href="https://tails.boum.org/getting_started/index.en.html">put it on a USB drive or a CD</a>. Be aware of what it <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/index.en.html">does not do for you</a>.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">For Android, you can get Orbot from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android">Google Play Store</a> or from <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> (recommended).</h3>

        <h3 class="bullet">A phone call will suffice. This is because you will recognize their voice - no (regular) texting!</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">You can skip the phone call if you have already established a secure conversation with them in some other way.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">For example, if you've verified their identify over OTR, you can use OTR to send them your key.</h3>

        <h2 class="bullet">Keysigning best practices: for people you <em>don't</em> know</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">This isn't nearly as convenient. :(</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">At <strong>minimum</strong> you must require at least one form of government-issued photo identification. A drivers license will work, as well as a passport.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Compare photo ID to them, and compare the name on the ID to the name on the key</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">If possible, send your signature to them instead of uploading it.</h3>

        <h3 class="bullet">For pretty much everything on GNU/Linux, you want to use GNOME Keyring. This is probably already installed; if not, use your package manager's software installation tool to install it.</h3>
